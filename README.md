# Welcome To The Pet Adoption Store!
You will be creating a web app that helps pets find homes!

## Before you begin
Please create a mockup of your website for an instructor to approve :)

## Set-up your files
Please create the following files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- README.md

Create a link tag for your CSS stylesheet in your html document.

## HTML
1. Create a header containing the name of your pet store using a **header** tag and set the value of the id attribute to `store-name`.

2. Create a container for all of your pet profiles using a **div** tag and set the value of the id attribute to `all-pets`.

3. Create at least 5 individual pet profiles using a **div** tag and set the value of the class attribute to `individual-pet` for each profile.

4. For each pet profile:
  - Create a Header containing the pet's name using a **header** tag smaller than **h1**.
  - Find five images of your pets on the internet.
  - Create a profile photo for each pet using an **image** tag and set the value of the source attribute to the image's URL.
  - Create a description for each pet using a **paragraph** tag.

*Stretch Goals* Wouldn't it be cool if each profile could make a sound? Add an audio tag to each pet profile.

## CSS
1. Set the background color of the body using the `element` selector.

2. Change the font color of the header using the `id` selector.

3. Change the styles of the pet profiles using the `class` selector.
  - Align all the pet profiles and their content to the center of their container element.
  - Set all pet profile photos to the same size.
  - Align all pet profile text to the center.

4. Modify your elements with these style attributes:
  - `background-color`
  - `color`
  - `font-size`
  - `font-family`
  - `height`
  - `text-align`
  - `width`

*Stretch Goals* Use at least 5 different style attributes that we did not mention!
